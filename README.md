# python_chat_app

A Python implementation of a server/client chat system.
 The server program must be run on a UNIX (Mac or Linus) machine.
 clients programs run on the same machine will then connect to the 
 chat server. The system supports some commands and the broardcast 
 of messages to all clients connected in the chat room.

Currently the system is hosted on a loopback address 127.0.0.1,
 meaning the server will be running on the local host machine.
